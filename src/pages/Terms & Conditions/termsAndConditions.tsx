<h2>1. OUR PRODUCTS; TERMS OF SALE SUBSCRIPTION</h2>
By agreeing to these Terms, Company licenses its Platform to you on a subscription basis. Any fees which Company may charge you for the use of the Platform may be as set out on the Platform or in an order form at the time of purchase for the subscription are due immediately (unless an order form states otherwise) and are subject to the refund policy of the Company stated in this section.
<br /><br />
By default all subscriptions unless stated otherwise in writing have auto renew as a feature. If you have a subscription with an auto renewal as a feature, you authorize Company to maintain your account information and charge that account automatically upon the renewal of the subscription you chose with no further action required by you. In the even that Company is unable to charge your account as authorized by you when you enrolled in an auto-renewing subscription, Company, may, in its sole discretion: (i) bill you for your previously selected subscription type and suspend your access to the Platform until payment is received, and/or (ii) seek to update your account information through third party sources (i.e., your bank or a payment processor) to continue charging your account as authorized by you.
<br /><br />
In addition to the price due for your subscription, if there are delinquent amounts or chargebacks associated with your payment, you may be charged fees that are incidental to our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees or other third-party charges.
<br /><br />
If Company is unable to collect any amounts due via your selected payment method, you authorize Company to charge any other payment methods on file in your Company account (unless you have previously removed the authorization to charge such payment method(s)). In addition to other remedies Company may have due to your failure to pay any amounts when due, you shall pay Company a late payment charge equal to 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if lower), along with all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees Company incurs in collecting such amounts.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<h3>Pricing and Availability.</h3>
All prices for Products (and the associated costs of shipping and tax) are shown in U.S. dollars. Depending upon your credit card’s currency and the country in which your card was issued, your credit card provider may impose foreign exchange fees, conversion fees and other fees which are in accordance with your arrangements with that credit card provider. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your payment, please contact your bank. Company is not responsible for such fees and will not reimburse you for any such fees incurred. All items are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or part of an order, and to discontinue Products without notice, even if you have already placed your order.

All prices are subject to change without notice as the Company deems necessary for Company’s business at any time. You agree that taxes may be adjusted from the amount shown on the payment screens.

<br /><br />
<h3>Currency Conversion.</h3>

For currencies that are denominated in large numbers, Company may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100, or 1000 of the currency; for example and not by way of limitation, Company may round up an amount of 1135 to 1140 and 1134 down to 1130 if the currency is denominated by base 10.

<br /> <br />

<h3>Chargeback Policy.</h3>

<br /><br />
